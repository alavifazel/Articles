These articles are meant to cover the topics of electrical and electronic engineering in detail. They will start off by articles on mathematics backgrounds and build up to more advanced and real-world applications of EE.

## Articles
0. [Miscellaneous_math_concepts](https://github.com/PowerNX/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/1_Misc_math_concepts.pdf)
*Covers general math concepts which are useful for our study.*
1. [Discontinuity of derivatives](https://github.com/PowerNX/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/0_Discontinuity_of_derivatives.pdf)
*Answering the question of "how much discontinuous our derivative functions can be"*
2. [Logarithm and exponential functions.](https://github.com/PowerNX/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/1_Logarithm_and_exponential_functions.pdf)
*The math behind exponentials and how they appear in circuit analysis*
3. [RMS value and boilerplate C++ classes](https://github.com/PowerNX/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/2_Rms_and_boilerplate_cpp_classes.pdf)
*The concept of root mean square (rms) and the reason we define it for AC signals. We also implement some boilerplate C++ classes to work with electrical signals in our projects* 
4. AC circuits and phasor diagram -
*The circuits consist of AC Sources and phasor diagram for representing sinusoidal functions*
5. [Transformers](https://github.com/PowerNX/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/4_Transformers.pdf)
*The basics of single-phase transformers and why it's used in power transmission.*
6. TBD

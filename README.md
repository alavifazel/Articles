These articles are meant to cover the topics of electrical and electronic engineering in detail. They will start off by articles on mathematics backgrounds and build up to more advanced and real-world applications of EE.

## Articles
1. [Discontinuity of derivatives](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/0_Discontinuity_of_derivatives.pdf)
*Answering the question of "how much discontinuous our derivative functions can be"*
2. [Logarithm and exponential functions.](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/1_Logarithm_and_exponential_functions.pdf)
*The math behind exponentials and how they appear in circuit analysis*
3. [RMS value](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/2_Rms_value.pdf)
*The concept of root mean square (rms) and the reason we define it for AC signals.*
4. [Boilerplate C++ classes for electronics](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/4_Boilerplate_cpp_classes_for_electronics.pdf)
*Implementation of a few boilerplate C++ classes for working with electrical signals*
5. [Transformers](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/4_Transformers.pdf)
*The basics of single-phase transformers and why it's used in power transmission.*
6. [The idea behind UNIX numeric file permissions](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/6_The_idea_behind_UNIX_numeric_file_permissions.pdf)
*The generalized idea behind the numbering system used for representing UNIX file permissions*
7. [Existence and uniqueness of first-order differential equation solutions](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/7_Existence_and_uniqueness_of_first_order_ODEs.pdf)
*Let's say you found a function that satisfies a differential equation. Is it the only possible solution to this equation?*
8. [Existence and uniqueness of second-order linear differential equation solutions](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/8_Existence_and_uniqueness_of_second_order_linear_ODEs.pdf)
*The extended version of existence and uniqueness for second-order DEs*
9. TBD
